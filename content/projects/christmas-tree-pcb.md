I made a little Christmas tree that lights up and plays a song through a buzzer. I wanted a simple project to expand my skills with schematic capture and PCB layout, and to see how accurate the quick turnaround prototype shops (PCBWAY) do. This project uses an ATTiny402, 3 shift registers to control the LED's, and a simple circuit to try a piezo buzzer. I used Kicad as my EDA tool. It was fun using AI + InkScape to generate different graphics for the tree and import them for the edge cut and silkscreen layers.
