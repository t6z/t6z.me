I trailered my 2016 Indian Scout from Colorado to North Dakota. U-Haul rents an open trailer specifically for hauling a motorcycle, but I wanted to use an enclosed trailer to strap other stuff to the walls. The 5ft x 8ft U-Haul was a good, cheap option for moving my bike across the country.

I had a difficult time finding pictures and information online of how these smaller U-Haul's are setup (inner dimensions, tie-down points, etc.), so I took pictures of my setup to share. 

## Wheel Chock

I bought a Pittsburgh Motoryclce branded wheel chock from Harbor Freight. The wheels on my bike were too wide / large to fit so I drilled additional holes to adjust the rear pin to be further back.

Using two ratchet straps it was easy to secure the wheel chock using the D-rings inside the trailer. I criss-crossed the ratchet straps to keep the chock secured in the center.

## Tie-down Points

I bought some soft loop tie-down straps and tied down the motorcycle in 4 locations -- 2 at the base of the front forks, 2 to the frame under the seat. There are multiple D-rings at floor level along sides of the trailer to use.

## Straps settling!

The strap loops tied to the frame settled and loosed up after driving for a bit. I stopped after driving the trailer a little bit because the roads out of the Denver area were bumpy and full of pot holes. The straps on the frame were loose and the rear tire of the bike had shifted an inch or two. 

## All done

This little U-Haul worked good for trailering my bike!
