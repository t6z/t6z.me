I started using Linux Mint daily a few years ago, but I still forget some really basic commands because I don't use them that often. I usually need to search for the same things, so I'm just going to start putting them in here so I can reference this page instead. These commands are probably really simple and I don't know why I always forget them.


## apt / dpkg

| Command                    | Description  |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| `sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE` | install .deb |
